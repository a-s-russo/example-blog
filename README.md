# Example blog site

This repository contains code to build an example blogging website. The user can read, create, edit and delete simple blogs. (There is no persistent storage, so the blogs are not preserved across sessions.)

2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Open a terminal in the root folder of the downloaded/cloned repository and run `npm i` to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `node server.js` in the terminal to start the server.
5. Navigate to (http://localhost:3000/) in a browser to see the website hosted locally on your machine.
